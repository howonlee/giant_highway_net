Massive Highway Net in Tensorflow
====

I figured that if the empirical results for cranking up the size of LSTM showed that it had extensive informational capacity, then other gated networks should have that property, because it is the gating which avoids the vanishing of gradients that LSTM so handily ameliorates. Important for practical applications is the highway network.

One possible reason why this would happen is a sort of analogy towards a lattice system at a critical state: you think of the incredible-depth property of highway net as a sort of induced critical slowing down of the gradient decay. If there is a critical slowing down, perhaps there is a concomittant critical correlation length divergence.
