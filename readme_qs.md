What are highway nets? How are they related to LSTM? What does gating do?

Why make them huge? What does extensivity mean here (did you make that bullshit up? yes you did)? talk about criticality.

What results did you get on a cool kids dataset (CIFAR-100)? Accuracy (that conforms to a cool kids paper on CIFAR, I guess)?

Let's have a chart comparing MLP as you blow it up and highway net as you blow it up. There is a limit to the MLP but shouldn't be for highway net.
